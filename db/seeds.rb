  {name: "Merl", species: "Goat", summary: "Merl needs a monthly sponsorship", fullDescription: "Tall, noble, and soulful, Merl the Goat is the king of Harvest Home Animal Sanctuary in Stockton, California. To his adoring friends (both human and non-human), Merl shares a gentle gaze in his eyes with a constant grin on his face. One thing is for sure, Merl is happy to be safe at a sanctuary now. Merl hasn't always been donning a grin however. Not too long ago, he came dangerously close to seeing the inside of a slaughterhouse. Covered in feces, dirt and urine, this 300-pound goat was found wandering in an vacant field near a horse stable in the Altamont Hills in California's San Joaquin Valley, an area known as an epicenter for goat slaughter. The stable owners were desperate to find a place for Merl as they didn't have a proper set up for goats. After weeks and weeks of searching for a new place for him without any luck, the stable owners decided they were going to send Merl to a slaughter auction. In a last-minute twist of fate, a local vet tech who learned about Merl's fate contacted us to see if we would save him. The answer was an absolute YES. Before long, Merl arrived safely at the sanctuary. We were so happy our rescued boy would never step hoof (foot) on the cold cement of a slaughterhouse kill floor. Today, Merl is enjoying life on perpetually green pasture with his first lady Mocha and eight other goat friends. To us, he's just a big guy with a big heart. Our motto for our lifesaving work is a simple one: sanctuary over slaughter. We see this motto come to life in Merl's calm eyes and grateful grin.

  {name: "Patton", species: "Rooster", summary: "Patton needs a monthly sponsorship", fullDescription: "Patton the Rooster defied death twice before finding sanctuary with us. He is a \"battery\" rooster who survived being shredded to death as a male chick at a commercial hatchery and thereafter lived at a battery cage facility with his egg-laying \"sisters\" for almost two years. As common as roosters are, Patton's story is quite unique. Each year, approximately 250 million male chicks in the United States are killed simply because they have no use to commercial egg producers. Male chicks are treated and discarded like trash in the egg industry. Patton's body is much smaller than other Leghorn roosters. We believe Patton's stunted growth is the result of being unable to stand up straight in a battery cage and grow normally. Patton is a feisty fellow. We completely understand his inner rage. He was confined in a tiny wire cage for the first two years of his life. Today, he enjoys life at the sanctuary. But, he isn't fond of the human race. We would love to restore Patton's faith in humans one hug at a time though. Several times a week, we cradle and hug this handsome guy. In time, we hope to win over Patton's affection.
