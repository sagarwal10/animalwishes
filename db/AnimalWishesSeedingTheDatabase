Make sure the db/seeds.rb file has no admin information (create that manually).
Make sure organizations are listed first then the Animals. 

To create a seed file: 
https://github.com/rroblak/seed_dump

rake db:reset (to drop the database)
rake db:setup (will populate the database from db/seeds.rb)
