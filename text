RICCO style
----------------
Say about 4-5 hours of work. Will send you a list of stuff to buy 
after surveying place. Rate is about $200 an hour. 

Can also create a mood board. 

-tiling: layout of tile, shape. design, etc will definitely be discussed on site and noted in the notes sections of the Plan.
-shower door installation: we give ideas as to what type of door to get - but installation/ordering we leave to the contractor/whoever is going to do the installing for you. We are not apart of the installation process.

The first time we meet would be for the Design Planning Session which starts at a minimum of 1 hour on site. I don't image we need much more than 1.5 hours for the Design Planning Session if we are only focusing on the bathroom. Of course that is al just a current estimate of time.

Pamela Urbanism design
---------------------------------
Very nice. Can consult for as much or as little as needed. Will let me know if its 
getting close to 5 hours. Can go shopping or willing to let do that. $125 an hour.
Will take more time if need 2D or 3D drawing. Doesn't require that you go through
entire process with her. Shares 50% of trade discount with client. Will do a productive
meet & greet. 

For tight budgets she has had clients go bring back samples from stores and she can 
tell if its good or bad. 

Estimates that bathroom remodel (without 2D or 3D design) will be about 5 hours.
